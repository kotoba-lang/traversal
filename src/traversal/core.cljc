  "In what order to visit the elements, given a real cache.

  `layout` decides where bytes sit; this decides the sequence they are
  touched in. The two are independent — a perfect struct-of-arrays walked
  down the wrong axis still misses every line — and the second is usually the
  larger effect, because changing an order changes how much data crosses the
  slow boundary rather than how it is arranged once it is across.

  Three families, and they answer different questions:

  - **linearizations** (`:row-major`, `:column-major`, `:morton`,
    `:hilbert`) — how an n-dimensional index becomes one address. Space-
    filling curves are supposed to keep 2-D neighbours near each other in
    1-D. `neighbour-locality` measures that instead of repeating it, and the
    measurement is worth reading: on a 16×16 grid Morton's mean neighbour
    distance is *identical* to row-major's and Hilbert's is *worse*. The win
    is real but it is in block co-residency (80% against 50%), not in the
    mean — so the intuitive metric answers the wrong question.
  - **tiling** (`tile-plan`) — how large a block may be before it stops
    fitting in a named level of cache. The capacity is asked of `machine`,
    divided by the cores that share it, and multiplied by a stated occupancy
    fraction, because a tile that fills the whole cache on paper thrashes
    against everything else running.
  - **loop order** (`loop-order`) — which loop belongs innermost. This is the
    one that produces the textbook `ikj` matmul from first principles rather
    than from memory.

  Every permutation here is checked to BE a permutation (`bijection?`). A
  reordering that silently skips or repeats an element is not a slow program,
  it is a wrong one.

  Pure `.cljc`. Depends only on `kotoba-lang/machine`."

  Where they do win is `:same-block`, which is the question a cache line or a

    :verdict "Held. The model said 1.00x and the best tile (48) managed 1.06x,
              which is 6% and inside the run-to-run spread of this harness. The
              same sweep on the JVM at 3.77 ns/madd was flat, and this one at
              0.517 is very nearly flat — consistent with a threshold at 0.27."
    :caveat "The loop-ns constant was taken from the UNBLOCKED arm, so the
             model reproducing that arm's absolute time (234 ms predicted
             against 234.15 measured) is circular and proves nothing. The
             speedup between the arms is the part that was actually predicted."
    :other-side "Tested 2026-08-03 with a hand-written NEON kernel at n=1536,
                 where B is 18 MiB and does not fit L2. Blocking gave 2.688x --
                 so yes, past the threshold regime tiling matters a great deal.
                 But v1 PREDICTED 1.00x for it, which is why this model is now
                 v2: the failure was two independent errors, a bandwidth
                 constant measured at the wrong stride and a max() that assumed
                 an overlap the stride destroys. With 10.8 GB/s and no overlap
                 it predicts 2.69x. See the v2 notes above."}})

(defn tiling-benefit
  "What blocking can buy, before anyone runs it.

  `tile-plan` answers *how big a tile fits*. This answers the prior question —
  *is there anything for a tile to win* — and the two are independent. A tile
  can be perfectly sized and buy nothing, which is exactly what happened when
  `tile-plan`'s answer was measured on a JVM matmul: every block width from 8
  to 768 landed within 1.2x of every other.

  The reason is visible in one comparison. Blocking only moves the memory
  term, so it can only matter when the memory term is the larger one. Both
  `loop-ns-per-op` and `bandwidth-bytes-per-ns` must be measured somewhere
  the *other* one is not the bottleneck — see `machine-probe`'s calibrate
  path, and the 65% error that came of getting that wrong."
