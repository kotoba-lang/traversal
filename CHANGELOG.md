## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-03

`tiling-benefit` v2, after v1 was falsified by measurement.

A hand-written NEON matmul at n=1536 (B is 18 MiB, past L2) showed blocking
worth **2.688x**. v1 predicted **1.00x**. Two independent errors, both worth
naming:

1. **Bandwidth is not one number per machine.** The same M1 Max gives 30 GB/s
   on a line-strided scan of a contiguous array and 10.8 GB/s to an unblocked
   matmul walking B with a 12 KiB stride. v1 was handed the first and asked
   about the second.
2. **`max()` assumes an overlap that stride destroys.** With a prefetcher
   covering the latency, loop and memory run concurrently and the slower one is
   the cost. With a stride that defeats prefetch, misses stall the pipeline and
   the costs *add*.

With the right bandwidth and no overlap: predicted 4278 ms against 4282
measured, 0.1%. v2 takes an `:overlap` verdict, always reports both
`:speedup-bounds`, and says in the model data that choosing between them needs
a fact about the stride it is not given.

The earlier scalar result still fits the optimistic bound: unit-stride inner
loop, prefetch works, predicted 1.00x and measured 1.06x.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-08-03

`tiling-benefit` gains a held-out validation, on one side of its threshold.

A C -O2 blocked ikj matmul at n=768 runs at 0.517 ns per multiply-add — above
the 0.27 ns threshold the model reports — so the model predicts blocking buys
nothing. Measured: the best tile managed 1.062x, six percent, inside this
harness's spread. Predicted 1.00x. Held.

Two honest limits recorded with it. The loop constant came from the unblocked
arm, so the model reproducing that arm's absolute time (234 ms predicted
against 234.15 measured) is circular; only the speedup between arms was really
predicted. And the *other* side of the threshold is untested: a kernel below
0.27 ns/madd should show tiling mattering a great deal, and clang -O2 only got
to 0.517, so confirming it needs a hand-vectorised kernel nobody has written.


## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-03

`tiling-benefit` — is there anything for a tile to win?

`tile-plan` answers how big a tile *fits*. That is a different question from
whether blocking buys anything, and the two came apart when `tile-plan`'s
answer was measured: every block width from 8 to 768 landed within 1.2x of
every other on a JVM matmul.

`tiling-benefit` predicts that. Given the measured inner loop (3.77 ns per
multiply-add) and bandwidth (30 GB/s) it reports a 1.00x achievable speedup and
`:worth-tiling? false`, because both arms are loop-bound and blocking only
moves the memory term. It also reports `:loop-ns-threshold` — 0.27 ns per
multiply-add, roughly one cycle — which is how fast the kernel would have to be
for a tiling sweep to be worth running.

With a vectorised kernel at 0.05 ns/op the same call returns 5.3x, not the 23x
traffic ratio, because blocking makes the arm loop-bound again. Blocking helps
until the loop becomes the limit and the model says where that is.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-03

Initial implementation.

- Linearizations: row-major, column-major, Morton (2-D and 3-D), Hilbert
  (2-D). Round-trip and bijection tested; extents a curve cannot cover are
  refused rather than silently returning positions with holes.
- `neighbour-locality` — measures the space-filling-curve claim instead of
  repeating it, and finds that the mean neighbour distance does NOT favour the
  curves (Morton ties row-major, Hilbert is worse). The win is block
  co-residency, 80% against 50%.
- `tile-plan` — largest square tile fitting a named cache level, using the
  PRIVATE share of that level, a stated occupancy fraction, and rounding down
  to whole lines. Carries its model, including what it does not model.
- `loop-order` — derives the textbook `ikj` matmul order from strides, with
  cost saturating at one line's worth of elements.
- Bit budgets enforced (2-D 15 bits, 3-D 10) so JVM and cljs agree, rather
  than a cljs interleave silently going negative.
